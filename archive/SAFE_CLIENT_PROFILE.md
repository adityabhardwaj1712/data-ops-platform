# Safe Client Profile (Sprint 5)

## Accepted Client Archetypes
- **Small Business / Founder / Agency**: Decision makers who are close to the problem.
- **Non-Urgent Needs**: The data is for analysis, enrichment, or a non-critical feature.
- **Flexible Timeline**: "I need this in about a week" is okay. "I need this by Friday 5PM" is NOT.
- **Outcome-Focused**: Wants *data* (CSV/JSON), not a dashboard, platform, or SaaS.
- **Technical Realism**: Understands that scraping is messy and not 100% perfect.

## ❌ HARD REJECTS (Do Not Accept)
- **Enterprises**: Too much red tape, too many requirements.
- **Hard Deadlines**: "Must be done by X" = Automatic NO.
- **Mission Critical**: "My app breaks if this stops" = Automatic NO.
- **Litigious Industries**: Law, Health (HIPAA), Finance (High Frequency).

## PM Rule
> First client should feel forgiving, not demanding.
