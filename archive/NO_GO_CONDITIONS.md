# No-Go Conditions (Hard Blocks)

**PM Rule**: Saying no early protects your system and sanity.

## 1. Operational Risks
- [ ] **Unrealistic Deadlines**: Request requires delivery in < 48 hours for a new site.
- [ ] **Massive Scale**: Request exceeds 5,000 pages (Current Sprint Limit).
- [ ] **Real-Time Requirements**: Client needs "live" data or < 1 hour latency.
- [ ] **dashboarding**: Client creates dependencies on a visual dashboard (Stick to Data-as-a-Service).

## 2. Technical Risks
- [ ] **Login Required**: Site is behind a user authentication wall (Legal/TOS risk).
- [ ] **Aggressive Anti-Bot**: Site uses heavy captchas (ReCaptcha v3/Enterprise) or behavioral biometrics (Akamai/Cloudflare waiting rooms).
- [ ] **Flash/Canvas/Applets**: Obsolete or non-standard rendering.

## 3. Client Risks
- [ ] **Vague Requirements**: "Just get me everything." (Reject until schema is defined).
- [ ] **Litigious Verticals**: Government, Healthcare (PHI), Banking (PII), Law firms.
- [ ] **Disrespectful Communication**: Any sign of pressure or devaluing the work.

## The Script
