# Operational Limits & Fatigue Check

**PM Rule**: Burnout kills good systems.

## Self-Assessment (Sprint 6)

### Capacity
- **Max Jobs Per Week**: [2] (Start conservative)
- **Max HITL Hours Per Day**: [1.5 hours] (Focus drains fast)
- **Buffer Day**: [Wednesday] (No new starts, just cleanup)

### Fatigue Watchlist
*Signs to stop accepting work:*
- [ ] Dreading the "Open Ticket" notification.
- [ ] Skipping verification steps to "just get it done."
- [ ] Irritation at minor parsing errors.

### Mitigation Strategy
If fatigue flags trigger:
1. **Pause Intake**: Activate "Waitlist Mode".
2. **Simplification**: Reject any Tier 2+ work. Only take Tier 1 "Happy Path" jobs.
3. **Hard Stop**: No coding/scraping after [8:00 PM].
