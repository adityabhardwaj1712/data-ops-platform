# Engagement Agreement (Draft)

## Summary
This is a consulting engagement to deliver specific data from a specific source. It is not a software subscription or a guaranteed ongoing service.

## ✅ What We Deliver
- **Clean Data**: Structured data in CSV or JSON format.
- **Human Verification**: We spot-check data for quality.
- **One-Time Delivery**: Unless specified, this is a snapshot.

## ❌ What We Do NOT Guarantee
- **100% Coverage**: We aim for high coverage, but anti-bot measures may limit total yield.
- **Real-Time Updates**: This is not a live feed.
- **Maintenance**: If the site changes tomorrow, a new engagement is needed to fix the scraper.

## Timelines & Revisions
- **Timeline**: Estimates are flexible. We prioritize correctness over speed.
- **Revisions**: Up to 1 round of fixes for missed fields or data quality issues within scope.
- **Payment**: 50% Start / 50% Delivery (Standard Terms)

## Output Format
