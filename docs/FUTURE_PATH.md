# Future Path Decision
*Strategic direction for Q3-Q4 2026. Locked as of Sprint 14.*

## The Choice
**Path B: Hybrid (Tech-Enable Service)**

## Why?
1.  **Product Scorecard (3.57/5)**: The system is robust internally but too complex for self-serve users (Product Killers: Custom Configs, Anti-bot).
2.  **Market Reality**: "Data as a Service" (DaaS) commands higher margins than "Scraping Tools" (SaaS). Clients pay for *results*, not *tools*.
3.  **Liability**: Operating as a service allows us to vet targets (Risk Assessment). A self-serve tool opens the floodgates to abuse.

## The Model
- **Frontend**: Internal Operator Dashboard + Client Portal for "Delivery Download".
- **Billing**: Per-Project / Monthly Retainer. Not "Per-Credit".
- **Scale**: Human-in-the-loop is a *feature*, offering Quality Assurance that pure SaaS cannot matching.

## Next Steps (Post-Sprint 14)
- **Freeze**: No new "SaaS" features (Billing UI, Self-Signup).
- **Focus**: Optimize "Operator Velocity" (make our team faster).
- **Sales**: Sell "Managed Data Pipelines", not "A Scraper".

**Status**: LOCKED 🔒
